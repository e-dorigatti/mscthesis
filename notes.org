 good book about physics

**** what is radiative transfer?
 http://iopscience.iop.org/chapter/978-0-7503-1052-9/bk978-0-7503-1052-9ch5.pdf
 transfer of energy from electromagnetic radiation (i.e. photons) to molecules in the atmosphere
 resulting in earth's temperature increasing or decreasing

  - absorption: molecule eats photon, increasing internal (rotation/vibration/speed) energy
        this results in the molecule colliding more with other molecules, spreading photon's energy => gas increases in temperature/pressure
        both radiation coming from sun, and radiation coming from earth
  - emission: molecule spawns photon, decreasing internal energy
        results in the gas cooling down/less pressure, provided the photon isnt absorbed by another molecule
        can be neglected because the athmospheric temperature is too low
  - scattering: photon bounces off the molecule, no energy transfer
        photons have very low momentum compared to molecules, thus bounces do not significantly affect the gas temperature/pressure
        scattering cannot be neglected in clouds!

 remember PV=nRT
 depends on the specific molecule (ozone, carbo dioxyde, oxygen, water vapor, ch4, ...)
 absorption and emission happen at discrete energies (with high probability), affected by temperature and pressure
 can deal separately with solar radiation (short wave/high energy) and radiation from earth (long wave/low energy)
 obviously very related to greenhouse effect

 earth gains energy at low latitudes (close to the equator), loses energy at high latitudes (close to the poles)
 atmosphere and oceans transports energy from low latitudes to high latitudes (general circulation)
 differential heating leads to motion: pressure gradient will push particles towards colder areas
 then earth rotation messes everything up but in general this is what happens

**** crash course on atmosphere
 first layer is troposphere (0 to 10/15 km ~ 1bar to 250 mbar)
     temperature decreases with height
         determined by lapse rate, typically 10 K/km
     contains most clouds, and therefore weather effects
     hot air (low altitude) goes up, cold air (high altitude) goes down
         creates good air circulation
 tropopause: separates troposphere and stratosphere, 10/20 km thick
 second layer is stratosphere (until 50 km)
     temperature increases with altitude
         not much air circulation
             one of the reasons why commercial airlines fly here
 mesosphere
     contains most oxygen and ozone

 temperature varies according to the gases (they absorb different amount of radiation)

**** very simple climate model for radiation
 incoming radiation (from sun) = outgoing radiation (from earth)
     in the long term
     otherwise earth would freeze/burn
 earth surface, then one layer atmosphere
 atmosphere absorbs a fraction of the radiation both from earth and sun
 predicted surface temperature : 11 degrees

**** slightly more complicated model for radiation
 subdivide atmosphere in cubes, do computations for each cube
     differential equations describing change in wind/temperature/humidity/etc. over time
     also based on their interactions
     tradeoff between computational time and granularity
         obviously cubic scaling
**** international standard atmosphere
 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Standard_Atmosphere
 works "vertically", atmosphere is divided in layers, temperature varies linearly within each layer

 https://www.google.com/search?client=ubuntu&channel=fs&q=international+standard+atmosphere&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8
     contains basic formulas to compute pressure within a layer

**** how is radiative transfer it computed?
 RRTM-G (faster and approximated version of RRTM)
     G = GFS physics, software platform for computations
     it's basically computing integrals


 RRTM: models the flow of electromagnetic radiation in the atmosphere
 http://climatemodels.uchicago.edu/rrtm/
     both incoming from sun and outgoing from earth
     parameters:
         direct sunlight (W/m^2)
             typically around 1360 W/m2
         albedo (=diffusive reflection of radiation by earth's surface) (0/1)
             global average 30% (incl. clouds)
         surface temperature (K)
         lapse rate (=decrease of temperature with altitude) (K/km)
         stratospheric height (km)
         co2/ch4 (ppm)
         relative humidity %
         low/high clouds % (I assume low/high refers to troposphere/stratosphere)
         drop radius (in the clouds) (micro-m)
         aerosols

 http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.574.1435&rep=rep1&type=pdf
 contains basic, high level formulas to compute radiation

**** approximations
 clearly, the atmospheric mechanics are very complicated and affected by many factors, most of which cannot be measured
     e.g. ships in the sea release particles that modify the albedo of the clouds
     e.g. clouds are much smaller than the grid used for the computations, thus their effect must be approximated somehow
 reanalysis: merge observations and fill gaps prediction from models to provide global coverage
**** evaluation
 compare with empirical data
     problem: not much data available (not far back in time, and on a quite coarse, non homogenuous grid)
 predict future and see if it's reasonable/if predictions match with past

**** problems
 small features are not captured by global climate models
 grid is very coarse, can only have averages
     e.g. land/sea change, height change due to mountains
     precipitations, winds, cyclones (number of)
         both intensity and duration
     can be refined by regional climate models
         i.e. smaller grid in certain areas, using conditions at border from global model

 discussion in the thesis on the benefits of faster computing
     https://youtu.be/-bvwS0mP7xw?t=8037
     e.g. emergence of high intensity & short duration precipitations
         underestimated (too long & too weak) by coarse grid models
     even though network is trained with coarse grid :(
         not sure it would be able to generalize to finer grids
             probably not
 
*** research methodology
 CRISP-DM (cross industry standard process for data mining)

** dataset
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RLfDVVcfIQ
*** ERA interim
 http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qj.828/full
    predecessor of ERA5
    reanalysis => for consistency over time and space
        correct bias in observations
        atmospheric, land, ocean, sea ice
        4D-VAR
    frequency: 79 km global, 60 levels, every 6 hours from 1979
    they actually have cloud coverage!!!
    makes me think we can get more fields....
        must be careful not to use fields that are computed after radiative transfer (for the current time sample)
        can use all features from previous time samples (if useful)

*** ERA5
 https://software.ecmwf.int/wiki/display/CKB/What+is+ERA5
 https://software.ecmwf.int/wiki/display/CKB/ERA5+data+documentation
 30 km horizontal resolution, =137 vertical levels (dont have to do interpolation)=, hourly output
     improved radiation scheme (=> better for us?)
     uncertainty estimates (=> better for data augmentation?)

 3d grid with horizontal resolution in the order of kms, and 96 vertical levels (below 80km, so each level is ~5/10 km)
     they (thesis) actually interpolated the 96 levels from the 16 levels present in the ERA dataset
 temperature of surface, temperature and humidity available for every point, not clear if co2 only at surface level
 big problem: does not include clouds (says the thesis...)

*** on using pressure instead of altitude to define levels
 in the atmosphere, the relationship between pressure and altitude is something like a=1-p^b with 0<b<1
     roughly linear until 10 km
     which means that, as pressure decreases, the altitude difference of evenly spaced (in pressure) samples increases
         to give an idea
             the troposphere goes from 0 to 12 km = 1000 to 250 mbar
             the stratosphere goes from 12 to 55 km = 250 to 1 mbar
         in the stratosphere, temperature increases faster with altitude (from -50 to 0, more or less)
             this means that when stratifying by pressure the temperature increases _very_ quickly 

 we use pressure because radiation depends on pressure and not on altitude

*** TODO evaluation of radiative transfer?
 can we just assume data is good i.e. model is correct?
     also related to reanalysis
 probably yes, that is the job of climate scientists

** network input
 NxN matrix by concatenating T/H for every level
     doesnt make sense ?!
 tried with 4x96 (T+H+surface co2+surface temp x 96 levels)
     say it didnt work, not very convincing on why
     gradient explosions
         why didnt they use gradient clipping?

*** DONE didnt mention using data from the neighborhood of the point
     i.e. have a 4d tensor of size 4xDxDx96 or 4xDxDxH
         maybe 5d if time is available
     note that appreciable changes in T/P horizontally happen in the scale of 100/1000 km
         assuming no clouds (which we dont have anyways)
         but radiance affected at most by 10 km neighboring conditions
             =basically, horizontal neighboring data points have no effect=
         from physics of the atmosphere page 5-20

*** DONE is this data enough to predict radiative transfer
 i.e. does it allow to generalize
 how to answer: research on radiation models
 tentative answer: apparently cloud coverage has a sizeable effect
     but it was not included in the thesis
 since they compute radiative transfer with formulas, data must be enough
     and we are not concerned with the correctness of the model
         clearly, new model implies retraining of the network

**** TODO input augmentation
 idea: pre-compute stuff and feed it as input to the network
     data augmentation such as log(x)
     relevant physical constants (nah, im sure the network can learn those, if necessary)
     other physical quantities computed by simulations (that do not depend on radiative transfer)

 physical parameters that are used by the traditional RRTM model and depend on location
     eg albedo, stratosphere altitude, lapse rate, cloud coverage, wind, aerosols
         season averages should be easy to get
     problem: they might change over time
     _for now_ these are held fixed, and we train the network only on temperature/humidity

*** TODO use relative humidity instead of/together with humidity?

** network output
 target: compute heating in K/day for each altitude level (only from long wave radiation)

*** TODO can we get CI with a neural network, with a single forward pass?
 usually, climate simulations are run many times by slightly perturbing input conditions
     to get confidence intervals on output

 would produce an even bigger advantage relative to current methods
     must do literature research
     probably too advanced for this project anyways, but good future work

** network architecture
*** TODO use a RNN?
 bidirectional, process data top->bot and bot->top
 a la sequence-to-sequence

*** TODO use deconvolutions instead of FC?
 output should be self-similar

*** TODO or maybe use the same weights for every altitude level?

** data augmentation
 keeping in mind that climate simulations could span many 1000s years, so parameters might vary considerably

*** current situation
 currently, samples are generated by modifying historical samples as follows
     file test_radnet_2.py, function generate_new_profile
     for the temperature: tnew(p) = t(p) + slope * p + shift
         basically a linear increase/decrease with pressure (=altitude)
         note that pressure is low at high altitude, so the biggest change is at ground level
     the humidity is recomputed so that the relative humidity is the same
         temperature affects the saturation (=maximum) humidity
     the radiation is recomputed using the model

*** problem with using historical data
 some configurations are unstable and the simulation diverges (=explodes) after few time steps
     for example (seq. id in radiation_1980_m02_c69_43_v2.nc) : 1693, 480, 1927, ...
 other cases are quite static
     radiation stabilizes at the very top (last 4/5 samples) to around -40
     does not change much everywhere else
    
*** DONE use a variational autoencoder to generate new examples?
 a variational autoencoder seems good because we know how to sample from the latent features to generate new samples
 I guess it would only generate samples close to what is already in the training set, so not very useful for our purposes

**** variational autoencoders in a nutshell
 https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.05908.pdf
 basically, map the latent features to a multivariate normal with isotropic variance
 intuition is that you can get any distribution by applying a function to a normal distribution
 and we can sample from a normal distribution, therefore we know how to generate new samples
 that auto-magically follow the distribution of the latent variables

*** TODO use the RRTM model to perform simulations and produce new samples
 should find realistic initial conditions first
     +use historical data?+
         use the output from the VAE?
     research for typical conditions and ranges?
         can define distributions instead of ranges

*** DONE define a set of transformations to apply to existing samples?
 e.g. locally smooth changes in pressure/temperature scale
 question: if we always use the same transformation (with different coefficients), won't the network "overfit" it, e.g. by learning how to "undo" it


**** identify parameters and their distribution
 based on current best estimates
 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Standard_Atmosphere


**** humidity
 humidity has a sizeable effect on climate and radiation, thus it's important to get right
     https://users.physics.ox.ac.uk/~pierrehumbert/papers/CaltechWater.pdf
         says water vapor is the most important greenhouse gas
     one possibility is to convert from relative humidity to absolute humidity
         https://carnotcycle.wordpress.com/2012/08/04/how-to-convert-relative-humidity-to-absolute-humidity/
             can find maximum absolute humidity for a given temperature using eq. 10 in
                 https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/1520-0493%281980%29108%3C1046%3ATCOEPT%3E2.0.CO%3B2
                 quite inaccurate (>1%) with extremely low/high temperatures, but should be good enough for our purposes
     the problem of computing humidity is to compute accurately the vapor pressure of water
         vapor pressure of water = pressure at which evaporation equals condensation
             corresponds to 100% relative humidity
         many approximate formulas exist
             https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vapour_pressure_of_water
             seems like metpy uses Buck's formula to compute saturation pressure, so we will go for that as well
         absolute humidity can be computed easily given the vapor pressure of water and relative humidity
     Q: how does relative humidity vary with altitude?
         A: it's a very complicated pattern, starts at ~ 80% and drops to 0%, but seemingly random in between
             got away with regressing random points with an SVR, and scaling so that the RH goes to 0 at the top

**** TODO outcome
 the samples seem to have a very interesting long wave radiation profile, much more "curvy" than the one presented by historical samples, and it still features some swift variations

** work to do
 MY GOAL: improve data augmentation so that model works on arbitrary inputs
     why do this? why should the model work with non-realistic samples??
 and add clouds, later

 model cannot predict well conditions that are far from historical data

 problem: extrapolation of humidity/temperature near boundary (top of atmosphere)
     I see a pattern in the data: temperature sharply rising at the top, and radiance decreasing just as sharply
         but the network simply doesn't care, and predicts a smooth radiance that follows the trend
     NB: the drop seems to be caused by the sudden end of the ozone layer (ozone absorbs a lot of radiation => has high temperature)

 actually, the network cannot predict (most of the times) extremely low values of radiance, regardless of altitude
     so the boundary problem is for historical data just because it contains that condition at the boundary
     that is fundamentally the most important part of the simulation, because it makes the sharp increase in temperature increase altitude as time goes by
         so the *mean* squared error is deceiving, because the most important part is just a single sample
     idea: add another input column, with the difference in t(h)-t(h-1)
         could be learned by a convolution...

** other questions and issues
*** feedback loop in the output?
 how is the network going to be used? suppose it's used like this

 while true:
     radiation = network(temperature, humidity, ...)
     temperature, humidity, ... = climate_model(radiation)

 then even small mistakes will be propagated and eventually the output will diverge from what would be computed by a single climate model

* atmospheric boundary layer
** boundary layer meteorology
https://atmos.washington.edu/~breth/classes/AS547/
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMhGTDVuE-4

studies conditions close to the surface => how the surface affects the atmosphere
    based on boundary layer in fluid dynamics, plus some additional complications such as
        - surface temperature, causing air to heat (unstable, more turbulence, daytime) or cool (stable, less turbulence, nighttime)
        - rotation of the earth, roughness of the surface, earth's rotation, etc.
    height varies between ~100m to ~1km, highly depending on time of day
        surface layer: first ~50m, coriolis force is irrelevant
        air density can be assumed constant (varies in ~10km length scale)
    the atmospheric boundary layer is always turbulent
        because of instabilities, laminar flow would turn into turbulent flow
            shear instability: between surface and fluid
            kelvin-helmholtz instability: between fluid layers of different density
            convective (rayleigh-bernard) instability: when potential density decreases with height
                basically when a warmer fluid is below a colder one
        the ABL is not homogeneous, and a critical role of turbulence is to transport and mix stuff
    cannot be simulated in large scale models because turbulent motion happens at smaller scales
        so the effect is specified as a function of some "large scale" parameters
            aka parametrization
        e.g. in global circulation models
    study is conducted with respect to statistical properties of physical quantities
        decompose quantity a into sum of ensemble mean plus variation due to turbulence: $a=\bar{a}+a'$
            e.g. \bar{a'a'} = variance of a, \bar{a'b'} = covariance between a and b
            quantities depend on position and time, but indices are dropped to confuse people
        coordinate system is x = parallel to horizontal wind, y = orthogonal to horizontal wind, z = altitude
        u/w/v denote the wind velocity along the axes x/y/z
        (monin/Obukhov) similarity theory: under homogeneous and stationary conditions, every dimensionless group is an universal function of z/L
            sentence from "Exploring Self-Correlation in Flux–Gradient Relationships for Stably Stratified Conditions", Baas et al 2005
            L is a length scale that depends on the local conditions
            https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10546-006-9048-6
    *objectives*
        want to get wind/temperature/humidity profiles (profile=value as a function of altitude)
            e.g. in neutral (calm) conditions, wind profile is logarithmic
            either actual profile or change with respect to altitude
        want to get (turbulent) fluxes of ... , ... and ... ?
            roughly constant with altitude in the surface layer
            flux depends on vertical wind (because wind moves air duh)
            flux of a = \bar{w'a'} = covariance between variation in vertical wind speed and variation of quantity a
                legit to assume a causal relationship (?)
                aka eddy covariance, eddy correlation and eddy flux
        want to get relationship between profile (easy to measure) and flux (important for weather/climate)
            can be obtained via dimensional analysis (= combine things such that units of measurements match)
                then do experiments to find coefficients so that things match
                    obviously, experimental results disagree (in some circumstances)...
                        *hypothesis* variations depend on factors that were not considered
            see e.g. Businger et al 1971, "Flux-profile relationship in the atmospheric surface layer"
                https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/1520-0469%281971%29028%3C0181%3AFPRITA%3E2.0.CO%3B2

entrainment zone
    separation between atmospheric boundary layer (turbulent) and upper atmosphere (calmer, non-turbulent)
    a few 100s meters high

*** laminar/turbulent flow
laminar flow: neat and tidy, all particles move in the same direction
turbulent flow: movement of particles is highly chaotic
    best studied through averages

high viscosity tends to give laminar flow, low viscosity turbolent flow
    viscosity: how much the molecules of the fluid "stick" together

Reynolds number can differentiate between the two flows
    Re = inertia forces / viscosity forces

*** boundary layer in fluid dynamics
boundary layer: region of a (moving) fluid close to a stationary surface, where the velocity is lower
    fluid within the boundary layer moves more slowly (velocity must be 0 on the surface / no slip condition)
        velocity changes uniformly from upstream velocity to 0
    friction with the surface generates turbulence according to the viscosity
    viscosity is irrelevant outside of the boundary layer
        aka prandtl’s hypothesis

want to get shear stress on the surface, drag forces, etc.

*** surface fluxes
https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2407&context=usdaarsfacpub
https://scienceofdoom.com/2010/04/09/sensible-heat-latent-heat-and-radiation/

flux: quantity passing through a surface
surface flux: exchange of ... with the atmosphere through the surface
    mostly energy in different forms, then the flux is measured in watts per square meter

radiative fluxes R: due to longwave and shortwave radiation
turbulent fluxes: due to wind speed and difference between temperature/vapor pressure of air and surface
    sensible heat flux H
        sensible heat = heat exchanged when the temperature of the system changes
        caused by conduction and convection
    latent heat flux LE
        latent heat = heat exchanged when the temperature of the system stays constant
            for example, during phase transition (e.g. water boiling)
        in the context of surface fluxes, LE flux is caused by water movements (condensation and evaporation)

soil heat flux G
    apparently quite hard to measure, see document above
    G = R - (H + LE)
        radiative flux R is positive when surface receives heat from long/short wave radiation
        H + L is the total outgoing heat flux
        aka surface energy balance

other fluxes of interest:
    momentum flux
    CO2 flux
    surface evaporation flux (difference with latent heat flux???)

**** surface energy budged
G - R = H + LE
observations do not add up, so there is an imbalance (between 15%/100% at cabauw) 
    see this document, section 15.1
    http://projects.knmi.nl/cabauw/insitu/observations/documentation/Cabauw_TR/Cabauw_TR.pdf

** data collection

    gapfilling method
        http://projects.knmi.nl/cabauw/insitu/observations/documentation/gapfilling/cabcon_gapfilling.pdf

** what I have to do
use data to improve current flux-profile relationships, by incorporating more predictors
    specifically, predict wind shear and temperature gradient (aka lapse rate)
    main hypothesis: discrepancies found in experiments are due to factors that were not considered

*** TODO apparently the eddy correlation method to get flux intensity is quite inaccurate, do we bother?
    alternatively, the surface energy budget is imbalanced
    will this cause problems?
